Description: This package implements the classic equations of a Wright Fisher population found in any textbookk (e.g. Charlesworth & Charlesworth 2010). For speed efficiency, the implementation was done in C++ utilizing Rcpp. Alghouh simulations can be run independently, the package comes with a Shiny app for interactive plotting, where the different parameters of mutations, selection, migration, and effective population size can be modified.
